    Reproducibility Study on a PBPK Model of FcRn-Mediated Recycling for Large Molecules
  description: The PBPK model of FcRn-mediated recycling of large molecules was developed and studied by deWitte et al. (2023) to characterize and predict Immunoglobulin G (IgG) disposition in plasma and tissues. This study investigated the large-molecule model in PK-Sim and its applicability to molecules with FcRn binding affinity in plasma.
